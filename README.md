# JavaBulletJournal

## Need Statement: 
The demands of my life have become more strenuous and difficult to manage as I'm attempting to 
balance full-time employment, full-time school and a family with two children under 3 years old.
If I'm to be successful, I need to have absolute awareness of the things to be done and the ability
to track, assess and iterate my time-management and organization skills.

## Current State:
Currently just a basic ToDo list. Features will be added periodically to expand functionality.
The ultimate goal will be a fully-functional software bullet journal, complete with time-management
and tracking features, as well habit tracking and statistics.

## TODO:
- Separate the data layer from the JavaFX GUI app. The data layer should be hosted online with an API,
allowing data to be accessed and modified from various clients, including a web front-end.
- Add more features, including some kind of Pomodoro-style task timer, scheduler and habit-tracker.
